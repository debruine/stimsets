### london

Images are of 102 adult faces 1350x1350 pixels in full colour. Template files mark out 189 coordinates delineating face shape, for use with Psychomorph or WebMorph.org.

Self-reported age, gender and ethnicity are included in `london_info()`.

All individuals gave signed consent for their images to be "used in lab-based and web-based studies in their original or altered forms and to illustrate research (e.g., in scientific journals, news media or presentations)." Images were taken in London, UK, in April 2012.
